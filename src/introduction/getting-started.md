You might need prepare some tools if you want to be able to use the gRPC.

## Developer Tools

You can use any text editor based on your preferences, or here is my suggestion:
1. [Goland by Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/): It's my favourite text editor for Golang since it's designed specifically for this programming language. You have to [subscribe](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/buy/#personal) if you want to use it.
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It's my favourite text editor in general use cases since it's open source, and have many extensions (Golang, one of them)

## Another Tools

1. [buf.build](https://buf.build/docs/installation): one of seamless builder from *.proto to your destination programming language (You might need to check either your programming language is support build using this or not)
