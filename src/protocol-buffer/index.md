# What is Protocol Buffer?

Protocol buffers (Protobuf) are Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. (Source: [protobuf.dev](https://protobuf.dev/))

Protocol Buffers supported programming languages:
| Language                             |

| Java                                 |
| Python                               |
